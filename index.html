            <p>A simple and definitely not the most efficient implementation of elementary one-dimensional cellular automata.
            I hope I will have the time to dig into how to make it perform better.
            At the moment a set of rules and a starting position are picked at random (out of a set collection of rules) and the resulting automata is displayed.
            Ideas for further development:<br>Create an API that accepts a rule as a URL paramater?<br>Create a user interface that allows
            the user to select a rule?
